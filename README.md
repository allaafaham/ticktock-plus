## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/allaafaham/ticktock-plus/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/allaafaham/ticktock-plus/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/allaafaham/ticktock-plus)](https://www.github.com/allaafaham/ticktock-plus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/allaafaham/ticktock-plus), navigate to the "Settings" tab.
- In Settings, click on the "Pages" link from the menu on the left.
- From the "Build and deployment" section, click the drop-down called "Branch", and select the **main** branch, then click "Save".
- The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed message display to indicate the successful deployment.
- Allow up to 5 minutes for the site to fully deploy.

The live link can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://allaafaham.github.io/ticktock-plus).
